I. Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks (ANN) are extremely powerful structures that are capable of relating input-output data with utmost complexity. The increment in computational power provided by the new generation Graphical Processing Units (GPU) in the last decade enabled ANN to solve many engineering problems in various fields of study (e.g., Computer Vision, speech recognition, Natural Language Processing, power transfer [1], etc). There are different flavors of ANN designed for different applications depending on the needs. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most preferred type of network commonly employed in regression and classification problems, which are two major functions of a ANN.

A. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
We will study MLP elaborately throughout the course. Regression and classification examples, both supervised learning. Please see Fig. 1 for an example MLP network structure.
